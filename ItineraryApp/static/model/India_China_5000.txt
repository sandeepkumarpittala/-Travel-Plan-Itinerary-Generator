Okay, here's a potential trip plan from India to China, balancing historical sightseeing, cultural experiences, delicious food, and aiming for a $5000 budget (for one person, assuming a trip duration of about 10-12 days).  **Important:**  This is a guideline.  Prices fluctuate wildly based on the time of year (avoid Chinese New Year!), booking in advance, your specific dates, and your travel style.  This plan leans towards mid-range comfort with some budget-friendly options.  You'll need to actively search for deals and be flexible to stay within budget.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Budget:** $5000 USD (for one person). This EXCLUDES your Indian visa costs and travel insurance.
*   **Duration:** 12 days/11 nights (adjust as desired).
*   **Travel Style:**  A mix of comfort and budget-friendliness.  Mid-range hotels with some budget-friendly meals.
*   **Time of Year:**  Assume shoulder season (Spring or Autumn) for better weather and potentially lower prices.  Avoid peak summer (hot and humid) and winter (cold in many regions).
*   **Flights:** Economy class.
*   **Internal Transport:**  Mix of high-speed trains and local transport (metro, bus).
*   **Visa:**  You are responsible for obtaining the necessary Chinese visa from India well in advance. Start this process ASAP.
*   **Health:**  Consult your doctor about necessary vaccinations and health precautions.

**Currency:** All prices in USD unless otherwise specified. I'll try to provide RMB equivalents where helpful, but exchange rates can vary.
* **Exchange rate:** 1 USD=7.25 RMB

**Phase 1: Pre-Trip Planning & Booking (Do this ASAP!)**

1.  **Flights (Approximately $800 - $1200 roundtrip):**

    *   **Route:** Look for flights from a major Indian airport (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata) to a major Chinese airport (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou).  Consider multi-city flights (e.g., Delhi to Beijing, Shanghai to Delhi) to maximize your itinerary.
    *   **Airlines:** Check airlines like Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, Singapore Airlines (often a good option with a layover), or other international carriers.
    *   **Booking:** Use flight comparison websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, or Momondo. Be flexible with your dates to find the best deals.  Consider booking directly with the airline once you find a good price.
    *   **Example:**  A roundtrip flight from Delhi (DEL) to Beijing (PEK) could potentially be found for around $900-$1100 if booked well in advance and during the shoulder season.

2.  **Visa:**

    *   Apply for a Chinese Tourist Visa (L Visa) at the Chinese embassy or consulate in India.  The application process can be lengthy, so start early. The cost may vary depending on the visa type and processing time, but expect to pay around INR 2000-5000 (roughly $25-$60 USD).

3.  **Travel Insurance:**

    *   Purchase comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, etc.  Expect to pay around $50-$100 for a 12-day trip.

*   **Stay in budget-friendly hotels:** Consider Jinjiang Inn, Home Inn, or similar chains. Look for deals on Agoda, Booking.com, or Ctrip.
*   **Eat like a local:**  Street food is delicious and much cheaper than restaurants. Look for smaller, family-run restaurants.
*   **Use public transportation:** The metro and buses are efficient and affordable.
*   **Take advantage of free activities:**  Walking tours, exploring parks, visiting temples (some have free entry).
*   **Bargain when possible:**  Especially at markets.
*   **Avoid tourist traps:**  They are usually overpriced.
*   **Drink tap water (after boiling):** Safe on the go.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Language Barrier:**  Learn some basic Mandarin phrases or use a translation app.
*   **VPN:**  If you want to access websites like Google, Facebook, and YouTube, which are blocked in China, you'll need to install a VPN on your devices before you arrive.
*   **Mobile Payment:** China is largely a cashless society. While you can use cash, having a local mobile payment app like Alipay or WeChat Pay will make things much easier. Registering with a non-China credit card will be complex.
*   **Download useful apps:** Pleco (English-Chinese dictionary), Google Translate, Baidu Maps (for navigation), Didi (ride-hailing app), and a VPN (if needed).

**Customization:**

*   This itinerary can be customized to fit your interests. If you're more interested in nature, you could spend more time in the Yellow Mountains or visit a national park.
*   If you're interested in history, you could visit more historical sites in Beijing or Xi'an.
*   If you have more time, you could add other destinations like Chengdu (pandas!), Guilin (stunning landscapes), or Hong Kong.

Remember to research and book well in advance, be flexible, and embrace the adventure! Have a fantastic trip to China!
