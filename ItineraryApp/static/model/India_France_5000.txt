*   **Transportation:** Utilize public transportation (metro, buses, trams). Purchase travel passes for unlimited travel. Walk as much as possible.
*   **Activities:** Take advantage of free activities (parks, gardens, churches). Look for free museum days or discounted entry for students/seniors. Purchase a Paris Pass (or similar city pass) *only* if it makes financial sense based on the attractions you plan to visit.  Prioritize what you really want to see.
*   **Souvenirs:** Buy souvenirs from markets or smaller shops, not from tourist traps.
*   **Free Walking Tours:** Look for free walking tours. They offer a great overview of the city, and you only need to tip at the end if you like the tour.
*   **Travel Insurance:**  Essential! Shop around for the best price.
*   **Visa:** Factor in the cost of a Schengen visa.
