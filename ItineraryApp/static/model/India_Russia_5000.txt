Okay, here's a possible 10-day trip plan from India to Russia, balancing historical sightseeing, cultural experiences, and food within a $5000 budget (excluding visa costs).  This plan focuses on Moscow and St. Petersburg, the two most popular cities, offering a good mix of what Russia has to offer.

**Important Considerations Before We Start:**

*   **Budget Flexibility:** $5000 for two people is *tight* for 10 days in Russia, especially if you want comfortable accommodations.  This plan relies on budget-friendly choices.  Be prepared to compromise.
*   **Visa:** This budget *excludes* the cost of Russian visas.  Factor that in separately.  Start the visa application process well in advance.
*   **Exchange Rate:**  The exchange rate between INR, USD, and RUB fluctuates.  I'll assume 1 USD = 75 INR for estimations.
*   **Travel Style:**  This plan leans towards independent travel, using public transport and affordable accommodations.
*   **Travel Dates:**  Traveling during the shoulder seasons (April-May or September-October) will help with costs and crowds. Summer will be more expensive.
*   **Booking in Advance:** Book flights and accommodations as early as possible for better prices.
*   **Flexibility:**  Be prepared to adjust the itinerary based on your interests and unforeseen circumstances.

**Assumptions:**

*   Budget for two people: $5000 USD = 375,000 INR
*   Flights (Round Trip for two):  150,000 INR (This can vary GREATLY depending on time of booking and origin city in India.  Search aggressively for deals.)
*   Remaining Budget: 225,000 INR for 10 days, roughly 22,500 INR per day or 11,250 INR per person per day.

**Flights (Estimated: 150,000 INR Round Trip for Two)**

*   **Route:**  Ideally, a direct or one-stop flight from a major Indian city (Delhi, Mumbai) to Moscow (DME, SVO, VKO) or St. Petersburg (LED).  Return from the other city.  (e.g., Delhi to Moscow, St. Petersburg to Delhi).
*   **Airlines:**  Consider airlines like Aeroflot (Russian Airlines), Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways (often have connections).  Check budget airlines, but factor in baggage fees.
*   **Booking Strategy:**  Use flight comparison websites (Skyscanner, Google Flights, Kayak) to find the cheapest options. Be flexible with dates.  Consider flying mid-week.  Book as far in advance as possible.
