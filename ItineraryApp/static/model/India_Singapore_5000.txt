Okay, here's a possible trip plan to Singapore from India for two people, focusing on history, culture, food, and staying within a budget of $5000 USD (approximately INR 415,000, depending on the current exchange rate).  This assumes a 7-day/6-night trip. I'll break down the estimated costs, and you can adjust based on your preferences.

**Assumptions:**

*   **Travel Dates:**  I'm assuming you're traveling in the shoulder season (e.g., March-May or September-November) to avoid peak tourist crowds and potentially higher prices.
*   **Accommodation Style:** Mid-range hotels or well-rated boutique hotels in convenient locations.
*   **Food Style:** A mix of hawker food, local eateries, and a few nice restaurant experiences.
*   **Flexibility:** This is a plan, not a rigid prescription. Be prepared to adapt based on weather, mood, and discoveries.
*   **Currency:** Costs are primarily listed in USD, but I'll also mention approximate INR conversions where helpful.
*   **Travel from:** The calculations for flights are based on travel from a major Indian city like Delhi or Mumbai.  Adjust accordingly if you're flying from elsewhere.

**Budget Breakdown (Estimates):**

*   **Flights (Roundtrip for 2):** $1200 - $1600 (INR 100,000 - 133,000)
